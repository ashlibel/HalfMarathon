# HalfMarathon
First time practicing reading input from the keyboard using a Scanner. Also doing a simple calculation.
A half-marathon is slightly longer than 13 miles. To train, you will run 5 miles each day this week, 6 miles each day next week, 7 miles each day the week after that, etc., until you reach 13 miles per week.  The program for this lab should ask how many miles you ran each day last week and then tell how many miles you have to run each day this week.  You can assume the person will type in a number from 0 to 12.
